   words cannot explain fine-tuning as well as a video can....due to the graphics.

    The reason i directly include videos in my website it due to 
    the reason thaat youtube might ban these videos, since 
    some people in youtube team might be baised
    , and second reason is youtube has ads that will hamper the experience of my viewers 
    Third to preserve  mobile data and reduce lag
